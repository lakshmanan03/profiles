It sounds like you want to provide constructive feedback for an appraisal that focuses on specific areas of improvement. Here are some points that maintain a professional and constructive tone:

1. **Limited Proficiency in Java Development**: He struggled to meet the technical expectations for a Java developer, often requiring additional support from team members to complete tasks.

2. **Lack of Initiative in Learning**: He showed minimal interest in improving his technical skills, particularly with Java, which limited his contributions to projects and hindered his growth.

3. **Reluctance to Take on New Tasks**: He often refrained from taking up new responsibilities, leaving many tasks to be picked up by other team members, which impacted overall productivity.

4. **Idle Time**: He was often observed as being idle or unoccupied, resulting in underutilization of resources within the team.

5. **Inconsistent Engagement with Assigned Work**: When assigned tasks, he exhibited low engagement and did not consistently meet deadlines or quality expectations.

6. **Limited Effort to Collaborate with Team Members**: He did not actively participate in team discussions or collaborate effectively, affecting team dynamics and project outcomes.

7. **Resistance to Feedback**: He was reluctant to take constructive feedback from peers and supervisors, which affected his ability to grow in his role and adapt to project requirements.

These points address specific areas of concern while leaving room for potential improvement in the future.
