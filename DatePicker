We would like to clarify that our current framework is designed to centrally create and manage sessions, with session propagation handled through cookies. This design is deeply embedded across multiple layers of the application and is tightly coupled with various modules and workflows.

Addressing this would require extensive refactoring and could introduce risks to the stability and integrity of the system. At this point, modifying the framework to accommodate a different session propagation approach is not technically feasible without significant architectural changes.
